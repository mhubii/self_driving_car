# Self-Driving Car
In this short project we aim to implement a self-driving car algorithm within a simulation environment.

## The Network
Our network architecture for the self-driving car is based on the [End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars]("https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf" Link to Paper) paper which was released by NVIDIA.

## The Environment
As environment we use a car driving simulation built by Udacity. The simulation can be found on their GitHub if you follow this [link]("https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim" Link to GitHub).
